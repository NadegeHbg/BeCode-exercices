# BeCode Formation Repo

This repository contains exercises and projects completed during the BeCode formation. The repo is divided into three main categories:

- [The Field](https://github.com/NadegeHbg/BeCode-exercices/tree/main/The%20field)
- [The Hill](https://github.com/NadegeHbg/BeCode-exercices/tree/main/The%20hill)
- The Mountain

## The Field

In the [field](https://github.com/NadegeHbg/BeCode-exercices/tree/main/The%20field), we covered the basics of web development, including:

- [Markdown](./The%20field/1.%20Markdown)
- [HTML & CSS](./The%20field/2.%20HTML%20%26%20CSS), where I completed [integration exercises](./The%20field/2.%20HTML%20%26%20CSS/1.%20Integration), worked on [responsiveness](./The%20field/2.%20HTML%20%26%20CSS/2.%20Responsiveness), and discovered SASS
- [JavaScript](./The%20field/3.%20JavaScript), where we worked with DOM manipulation in the front-end and Node.js/Express.js in the back-end.

## The Hill

In the [hill](https://github.com/NadegeHbg/BeCode-exercices/tree/main/The%20hill), we consolidated our knowledge and skills in both front-end and back-end development. Specifically:

  - Worked with timeouts and intervals
  - Worked with dates
